## What's the prupose of this project?
I made this simple app by aiming to improve my mobile app development skills with React Native.

## How it works?
By using <a href = "https://picsum.photos">**Lorem Picsum**</a> API to provide the images, the process become easy.

I created a **state** which receives an array with random numbers between 0 and 500, these are used in **Lorem Picsum**'s url to generate random images.
You can find it in <a href = "App.js">**App.js**</a>, exactly as here:
```js
<Image 
  source={{uri: `https://picsum.photos/340/280?random=` + item}} 
  style = {{...styles.imageStyle, width: width-40}}
/>
```

To make the images appear whenever the user get in the end of Flatlist is in following code:
```js
<FlatList
 renderItem={(item) => generateImage(item.item)}
 data = {image}
 onEndReached = {() => setImage([...image, Math.random() * 500])}
 showsVerticalScrollIndicator = {false}>
/>
```
